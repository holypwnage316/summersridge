                        13 Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” 14 But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?” 15 And he said to them, “Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.” 16 And he told them a parable, saying, “The land of a rich man produced plentifully, 17 and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?'' 18 And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. 19 And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.”’ 20 But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'' 21 So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.”

                        <li>
                            Review what happens before the parable, in Luke 12:13-15. Does "someone" from "the crowd" ask Jesus a question, as most people who approach Jesus do, or does that person command Jesus to act?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In Jesus' second response to the man (Luke 12:15), what does he detect to be this man's root sins? Turn to Exodus 20:17. How does the Bible define this sin?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Of the three parts of the tenth commandment - related to one's neighbor's house, spouse, and workforce - with which part do you struggle the most?
