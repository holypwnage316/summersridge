                        13 Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” 14 But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?” 15 And he said to them, “Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.” 16 And he told them a parable, saying, “The land of a rich man produced plentifully, 17 and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?'' 18 And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. 19 And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.”’ 20 But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'' 21 So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.”

                            When Jesus offers the reason why one should not covet (Luke 12:15), he reminds us that "the abundance of...possessions" is not essential to our survival; it does not necessarily lead to happiness (often the opposite); and it offers no protection against sickness, sorrows, calamities, or death. That said, why do we find Jesus' teaching here so hard to believe?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How many times does the rich man speak about himself -- using the words "I", "he", "himself", and "my"? What is Jesus emphasizing?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In Deuteronomy 8:18 Moses admonishes, "You shall remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth." Do you think that way abour your wealth? Why or why not?
