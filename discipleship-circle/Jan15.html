                        25 And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” 26 He said to him, “What is written in the Law? How do you read it?” 27 And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” 28 And he said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.”

                        29 But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” 30 Jesus replied, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. 31 Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. 32 So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33 But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. 34 He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. 35 And the next day he took out two adenarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.’ 36 Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?” 37 He said, “The one who showed him mercy.” And Jesus said to him, “You go, and do likewise.”

                            Think of a time when you saw someone in need -- perhaps a homeless man asking for food or a family with car trouble at the side of the road. Did you stop to help? If not, why? Were you busy or running late? Was it inconvenient? Were you afraid?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Does the man who approaches Jesus and asks him a question approach him with pure motives? Why does Jesus answer the man's question with a question of his own?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What is certainly appropiate to say is that the mercy of the Samartian symbolizes the greater mercy of Jesus Christ. Jesus goes out of his way to save us when we are not merely injured but dead becaused of our sin. What are some other connections to Christ here?
