                    <blockquote><i>Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. (Hebrews 3:12-13)</i></blockquote>
                    <h3>What are Discipleship Circles?</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Discipleship circles (DCs) are groups of 3-5 Christians of the same gender.</li>
                        <li>Meet regularly for putting off sin and putting on holiness through bible study, confession of sin, and prayer.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>When Should They Meet?</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Weekly or at minimum bi-weekly. DCs are smaller and therefore have greater flexibility to meet at a time that is best for the DC members.</li>
                        <li>Consistently.  CG and DC leaders continue to call every member back to DCs.</li>
                        <li>Complementary. DCs should complement and not compete with CGs. Consider breaking into Circles immediately after your regular CG gatherings.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>How Are DCs Formed and Led?</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Each CG leader is responsible to ensure DCs are formed among their CG by appointing leaders and encouraging every group member to connect to a DC.</li>
                        <li>Each DC should be led by one point-person (DC Leader) responsible for keeping the time focused on discipleship, confession, and prayer and keeping each person engaged.</li>
                        <li>Multiplying. When a DC exceeds five people, that DC should multiply.</li>
                    </ol>
